# Insurrection.Zargabad

## Project Outline

Insurrection Zargabad is an Arma 3 Mission file that is designed to act as a multiplayer gamemode for 3 players or more.

A group of peacekeeping forces located near to the fictional Takistan town of Zargabad, which is host to a Insurgent force. The Peacekeepers are tasked with eliminating the Insurgent force and have unlimited lives. The Insurgents must take out as many peacekeepers as possible before they are eliminated.

The Peackeeping and Insurgent forces have unique abilities, weapons and vehicles.

There is a civilian population that the Insurgent force can blend into. Some civilians may even spot peacekeeping forces using a % modifier on the population.

Historically this is just a sandbox gamemode between friends, devoped fully by Robbert Morton pre-publication to github and now collaborativly between Robbert Morton and Jordan Smart.
