--- ENGIMA'S CIVILIANS (VER 1.00) ---

Engima's Civilians is a script that adds dynamic civilians to an Arma 3 mission. Civilians spawn near player(s) and are removed again when they are far away. Works on maps with enterable buildings.

You can customize how many civilians there will be, civilian units classes, the maximum number of groups to use, minimum spawn 
distance, maximum spawn distance, and blacklist markers to define areas where no civilians will be. You also add callbacks if 
you want to do something when units spawn or being removed.

Script works in singleplayer, multiplayer, hosted, dedicated, for JIPs, and on any map with enterable buildings.


--- CUSTOMIZATION ---

Customize the script by editing the startup parameters. The startup parameters list is an array of key value pairs. A key value 
pair is a small array where the key object is a string with the name of the parameter setting and the value object is the actual 
value to be used.

Here is the simplest example that starts the civilian script with all default parameters. This code are to 
be put in Engima\Civilians\ConfigAndStart.sqf.

[] spawn ENGIMA_CIVILIANS_StartCivilians;

Here is an example that uses all parameters and first saves them in a variable named "_parameters". The function call (or spawn) 
that starts the civilian script is beneath. This code are to be put in Engima\Civilians\ConfigAndStart.sqf.

// Set civilian parameters.
_parameters = [
	["UNIT_CLASSES", ["C_man_1", "C_man_1_1_F", "C_man_1_2_F", "C_man_1_3_F", "C_man_polo_1_F", "C_man_polo_1_F_afro", "C_man_polo_1_F_euro", "C_man_polo_1_F_asia", "C_man_polo_2_F", "C_man_polo_2_F_afro", "C_man_polo_2_F_euro", "C_man_polo_2_F_asia", "C_man_polo_3_F", "C_man_polo_3_F_afro", "C_man_polo_3_F_euro", "C_man_polo_3_F_asia", "C_man_polo_4_F", "C_man_polo_4_F_afro", "C_man_polo_4_F_euro", "C_man_polo_4_F_asia", "C_man_polo_5_F", "C_man_polo_5_F_afro", "C_man_polo_5_F_euro", "C_man_polo_5_F_asia", "C_man_polo_6_F", "C_man_polo_6_F_afro", "C_man_polo_6_F_euro", "C_man_polo_6_F_asia", "C_man_p_fugitive_F", "C_man_p_fugitive_F_afro", "C_man_p_fugitive_F_euro", "C_man_p_fugitive_F_asia", "C_man_p_beggar_F", "C_man_p_beggar_F_afro", "C_man_p_beggar_F_euro", "C_man_p_beggar_F_asia", "C_man_w_worker_F", "C_scientist_F", "C_man_hunter_1_F", "C_man_p_shorts_1_F", "C_man_p_shorts_1_F_afro", "C_man_p_shorts_1_F_euro", "C_man_p_shorts_1_F_asia", "C_man_shorts_1_F", "C_man_shorts_1_F_afro", "C_man_shorts_1_F_euro", "C_man_shorts_1_F_asia", "C_man_shorts_2_F", "C_man_shorts_2_F_afro", "C_man_shorts_2_F_euro", "C_man_shorts_2_F_asia", "C_man_shorts_3_F", "C_man_shorts_3_F_afro", "C_man_shorts_3_F_euro", "C_man_shorts_3_F_asia", "C_man_shorts_4_F", "C_man_shorts_4_F_afro", "C_man_shorts_4_F_euro", "C_man_shorts_4_F_asia", "C_journalist_F", "C_Orestes", "C_Nikos", "C_Nikos_aged"]],

// Start the civilian script
_parameters spawn ENGIMA_CIVILIANS_StartCivilians;

Here is a complete list of the parameters and what they do:

* UNIT_CLASSES (Array): Array of unit classes that may be spawned. If you want to see more of one unit class than another, 
  then have it occur a couple of more often (or more seldom) in the array:
  Example: ["C_man_1", "C_man_1", "C_man_1", "C_man_polo_1_F_asia"]
  
* UNITS_PER_BUILDING (Number): Number of units that are spawned. Since we want to see a lot more civilians per area unit in a 
  city compared to the country side, the number is set as "number of units per building". Default value is 0.1 which means 
  that if you have 50 buildings near you, you will have 5 civilians near you. A building or a civilian is regarded as "near" 
  if they are within the MAX_SPAWN_DISTANCE of any player.
  Example: 0.1

* MAX_GROUPS_COUNT (Number): The maximum number of groups in Arma 3 is 144, and each civilian is most often put in a separate 
  group. This options is to prevent that too many groups are being spawned. E.g. if your mission make use of 30 groups except 
  for the groups created by Engima's Civilians, a good value here would be 110.
  Example: 100

* MIN_SPAWN_DISTANCE (Number): Minimum spawn distance in meters from nearest human player on the map. Civilian units always 
  spawn inside buildings, so this option may be quite small. It should be at least 100 meters less than MAX_SPAWN_DISTANCE.
  Example: 50

* MAX_SPAWN_DISTANCE (Number): Maximum spawn distance in meters from nearest human player on the map. Civilians more far away 
  than this number of meters are deleted. It should be at least 100 meters greater than MAX_SPAWN_DISTANCE.
  Example: 500
  
* BLACKLIST_MARKERS (Array): An array of marker hames for markers where no civilians are allowed to be. Civilians will not 
  spawn nor have destination position inside any of these markers. However, a unit may spawn on one side of it and get a 
  destination on the other, and then the civ will probably walk the shortest way and cross the area. To make sure that no 
  civilians are inside these markers, set them to be greater than MAX_SPAWN_DISTANCE in radious.
  Example: ["MilitaryAreaMarker", "NoCivsHereMarker"]
  
* HIDE_BLACKLIST_MARKERS (Boolean): Wether the area markers will be hidden or not. If true then the markers will be hidden on 
  the map for the players, otherwise it will be visible. Default value is true.

* ON_UNIT_SPAWNED_CALLBACK (Code): Code that is executed when a unit has spawned. Parameter _this is an array: 0: created 
  unit (Object). Note that this is executed with the "spawn" command.
  Example: { hint ("A unit named " + vehicleVarName (_this select 0) + " created!")

* ON_UNIT_REMOVE_CALLBACK (Code): Code that is executed just before a unit is removed. Parameter _this is an array: 0: unit 
  that will be removed. Note that this is executed with the "call" command. Default value is { true }. If you return false 
  then the unit will not be deleted.
  Example: { hint "Vehicle of type " + typename (_this select 0) + " will not be removed!"; false }

* DEBUG (Boolean): Whether script is running in debug mode or not. In debug mode all civilians are marked as dots on the map.
  Can be true or false. Default value is false.


- USING MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE -

Script cannot run in more than one instance.
